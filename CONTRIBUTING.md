# Contributing to Plant-Vision-Rover

We're excited to have you contribute! Following these guidelines helps to make the development process smooth and effective for everyone.

## ðŸ’» Workflow

1.  **Create a New Branch:** Before you start working on a new feature or fix, create a new branch from `main`. Name it descriptively.
    * Example: `git checkout -b feature/improve-model-accuracy`
    * Example: `git checkout -b fix/camera-bug`

2.  **Make Your Changes:** Write your code and test it locally.

3.  **Commit Your Work:** Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message.
    * **Good commit message:** `feat: Add transfer learning with MobileNetV2`
    * **Bad commit message:** `updated code`

4.  **Push to Your Branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

5.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to the repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch. Describe the changes you made and why.

## ðŸ’¬ Communication

Please communicate with the team before starting major new features to ensure we are all on the same page. Let's build something great together!
